Section 1:

To download the Arabidopsis genome, I went to Phytozome. From there, I was 
able to choose which files I wanted to download (i.e., whole assembly, CDS, gene
annotations, etc.). Phytozome was very kind as it provides the line code specific
to the files choosen. So, to download my genome and gene annotations I pasted
the link provided into the command line which uploaded it into my HPCC
enviroment. 
To upload my screenshots onto my GitHub repository, I started a new terminal
separate from the HPCC. This time, I worked directly on my personal computer 
terminal. I created a file containing screenshots and using various "git" commands
I uploaded that file to my repository. 
	First, I had to clone my git repository using "git clone <myrepositoryURL>
This initial command allowed me to work within the repository from my personal
computer. From here, I would continue to work within my repository (PLB812). 
	Next, I configured my git to my account using "git config --global 
"donne164@msu.edu". From here, I did the following: "git add <file name>,
"git commit" to finalize thechanges. Then finally "git push", which uploaded my new 
file to the repository. 

Section 2: 

I downloaded the SRA accession numbers from NCBI by going to the SRA Run
Selector for our BioProject. From here, I was able to select only my genes of 
interest and download the accession numbers: 
ERR754090
ERR754071
ERR754065
ERR754061
ERR754082
ERR754083
Now moving into the HPCC, I entered a dev node by entering "ssh <node>"
Using the "prefetch <SRA#> command, I was able to download my SRA number 
into a designated SRA directory. However, because the fastq files would be too 
large for my home space, I moved the SRA directory into my scratch space by 
typing "mv <path for SRA dir.> <scratch path (/mnt/scratch/donne164/)>.
From here, I had to activate my PLB812 codna enviroment, because that is where 
the SRA-toolkit 3.0 was downloaded. I did this by "conda activate PLB812".
From here, using the "prefetch" then "fasterq-dump <SRA #>, I was able to 
download all my fastq files.
