To install fastqc, I used the code: conda search -c bioconda fastqc. This provided me with every available version of fastqc for download. I downloaded the program into my PLB812 environment (before all this I activated the env using conda activate PLB812) using conda install -c bioconda fastqc. 
	Once the program was installed in my conda env, I started to write out the job script that will run my fastqc. 
	Working within my Assignment1 directory, which contains my SRA files, etc, I ran the following code:

#!/bin/bash --login 
#SBATCH --time=168:00:00
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=100GB
#SBATCH --job-name Donnelly_fastqc_Results
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.SLURMout

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

export PATH="${HOME}/miniconda3/envs/PLB812/bin:${PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/miniconda3/envs/PLB812/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"

fastqc -f fastq -o /mnt/home/donne164/SRA_Results/fastq_Results/PLB812_git/PLB812/Lab_assignment/Assignment1/fastqc_results ./*

I made it so that all files with the “.fastqc” extension (i.e., the results from my code) would output into a designated folder titled “fastqc_results”. 

I then did git add, push, and commit to upload the assignment onto my GitHub repository.
