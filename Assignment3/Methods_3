To view my fastqc files, I pulled the files from my repository to my local computer using “git pull.” This allowed me to open the PLB812 and directly open the .html’s in my browser. 

Most my sequencing results looked good after position 13, presumably dueto polyA tailing. Only ERR754083_1 and - _2 had vary erratic reads. As such, these two sequences had lower Phred scores than the others. 

I decided to trim off bases with quality scores less than 10 based on my specific sequences and the fact that 10 is considered a bad read. 

To perform the trimming, i used MINLEN=<#> to define a minimum quality score, HEADCROP:<#> to cut off the first 12 base pairs (presumably polya tailing leftover)

For my code, I did a loop system where it would trim and perform fastqc analysis on each fastq sequence defined in my list. The resulting .html and .zip files were output into a new designated folder. 

To add a new branch for Assignment3, I did the following commands: 
1. Git branch Assignment3
2. Git checkout Assignment3
3. Git add Assignment3
4. Git commit Assignment3

It took me a long time to get accurate results from this script but I used the manual and ...finally.. got it :)
