To view my fastqc files, I pulled the files from my repository to my local computer using “git pull.” This allowed me to open the PLB812 and directly open the .html’s in my browser. 
Most my sequencing results looked good after position 13, presumably due to polyA tailing as all the results showed almost zero% adapter content. Only ERR754083_1 and - _2 had vary erratic reads. As such, these two sequences had lower Phred scores than the others dipping below an acceptable score of 30. 

I decided to trim off bases with quality scores less than 10 based on my specific sequences and the fact that 10 is considered a bad read. I did not account for any leftover adapter sequence because all my samples showed close to 0% carry over.

I downloaded the trimmomatic program using “conda install -c bioconda trimmomatic” 

For my code, I did a loop system where it would trim and perform fastqc analysis on each fastq sequence defined in my list. The resulting .html and .zip files were output into a new designated folder. 

To add a new branch for Assignment3, I did the following commands: 
1. Git branch Assignment3
2. Git checkout Assignment3
3. Git add Assignment3
4. Git commit Assignment
