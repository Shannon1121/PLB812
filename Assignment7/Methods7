I already had the Arabidopsis genome downloaded and converted to a .gtf file from Assignment 4, so I just copied that into my new Assignment 7 directory. To download my fastq file, 

	<  faster1-dump SRR___ > 

I performed fastqc using, 
	< fastqc -f fastq SRR492407_1.fastq >

The reads were not high quality, so I trimmed the reads to only leave those higher than a shred score of 25 and then perroemd another fastqc report.

	< trimmomatic PE -threads 20 -phred33 SRR492407_1.fastq SRR492407_2.fastq SRR492407_trimmed1P.fastq SRR492407_trimmed1UP.fastq SRR492407_trimmed2P.fastq SRR492407_trimmed2UP.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10:2:True SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 >

I re-did faastqc to be sure the trimming worked to eliminate the low quality bases. 

The, I began to align my reads using BWA. 

	< bwa mem -t 10 Athaliana_447_TAIR10.fa > SRR492407_trimmed1P.fastq SRR492407_trimmed2P.fastq > SRR492407.sam >

I converted the .sam file output to a .bam file via samtools.

< samtools sort SRR492407.sam -o SRR492407.bam -O bam -@ 10 >

To understand the quality of my alignment, I ran flagstat to get my output statistics. 

< samtools flagstate SRR492407.bam -o mapping_statistics.flagstat >
